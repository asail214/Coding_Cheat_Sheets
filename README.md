2. **Console Input/Output** - Reading input and displaying output
3. **Operators** - Arithmetic, comparison, logical operators
4. **Control Flow** - Conditionals (if/else, switch)
5. **Loops** - For, while, do-while, foreach loops
6. **Methods** - Defining and calling functions with parameters and return values
7. **Arrays and Collections** - Working with various collection types
8. **Classes and Objects** - Basic object-oriented programming

### Intermediate Topics
9. **Constructors** - Different constructor types and initialization patterns
10. **Encapsulation** - Access modifiers and information hiding
11. **Inheritance** - Extending classes and polymorphism
12. **Abstraction & Interfaces** - Abstract classes and interface implementation
13. **Structs** - Value types vs reference types
14. **Enums** - Working with enumerated types
15. **Generics** - Type-safe collections and methods
16. **Indexers** - Custom indexing in classes
17. **Operator Overloading** - Customizing operator behavior
18. **Delegates & Events** - Function references and observer pattern

### Advanced Topics
19. **Exception Handling** - Managing errors and exceptions
20. **LINQ** - Language Integrated Query for data manipulation

## üéØ Purpose

These cheat sheets are designed to:
- Serve as a quick reference for C# syntax and concepts
- Provide clear, practical examples of each concept
- Help beginners understand core C# programming principles
- Assist intermediate developers in reviewing more complex topics
- Act as a study guide for learning C# programming

## üîç How to Use

Each file focuses on a specific topic with:
- Clear code examples
- Detailed comments explaining concepts
- Multiple examples showing different use cases
- Practical implementations you can copy and test

You can:
1. Browse the files directly on GitHub
2. Clone the repository to reference offline
3. Use the code examples in your own projects
4. Study each concept sequentially for structured learning

```csharp
// Example from the collection:
public class HelloWorld
{
    public static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Basic console output
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, C# developer!");
        
        // Reading input
        Console.Write("What's your name? ");
        string name = Console.ReadLine();
        
        // String interpolation
        Console.WriteLine($"Welcome to C#, {name}!");
    }
}
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Requirements

- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- .NET SDK (any recent version) for running examples
- Any code editor or IDE that supports C# (Visual Studio, VS Code, Rider, etc.)

## üìñ Learning Path

For beginners, I recommend following these files in sequence:
1. Variables & Data Types
2. Console Input/Output
3. Operators
4. Control Flow
5. Loops
6. Methods
7. Arrays and Collections
8. Classes and Objects

Then proceed to the intermediate and advanced topics based on your needs.
